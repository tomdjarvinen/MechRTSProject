Ideas surrounding RTS Style Scripting Game:
	Scripts are deployable, manual control is MoBa Style, you can deploy a script on active units via a convenient in-game menu which shows your available scripts.  These may take inputs e.g. locations or areas. 
		Script inputs: locations, zones, game objects, 'options'
	Map must have many points of contention between which you divide your resources
		E.g. 'Deployment zones'
	Probably there are 'creeps' which you can deploy and control and script
		Ways to contemplate stuff at the individual level and group level.
	We probably want to borrow liberally from various RTS and MoBa mechanics.
	Scripting budget: # of scripts running at the same time, script complexity metric.
